Yes, I can generate BibTeX entries for you—either from scratch or based on citations you've already shared. Since you’ve already listed multiple references in your earlier message, I’ll generate properly formatted and cleaned-up BibTeX entries for those sources.

Here’s a complete BibTeX file with the references you provided, cleaned up for accuracy, consistency, and completeness:
